# tower-defense-unity
A project using Unity 2018.x to create an open-source 2d top-down tower defense game.

Main goals of the project are to: 
  1. Publish to the google play store (android build target) with a possibility to extend to other platforms.
  2. Practice the KISS principle in design of the game. 
  3. Any overly complex operations/animations/sprites shall be saved for personal use or enjoyment,    this project is purely to learn and eventually show others one decent way of making a fun game.
